# DEPRECATED

This package is no longer under support. 
The release tool this package is based off of ([exrm](https://github.com/bitwalker/exrm)) is deprecated and replaced by [distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery).
Instead you should use [mix_docker](https://github.com/Recruitee/mix_docker) which makes use of Distillery.

# ExrmDocker

Create a Docker image from your Elixir release

## Usage

To create a new Docker image simply run:
```shell
mix release --docker
```

This will output the `docker build` result with the created image id.

To specify docker image tag you can use `--tag` option:

```shell
mix release --docker --tag=test:0.3

docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG   IMAGE ID       CREATED         VIRTUAL SIZE
test         0.3   6d3d5f9abac4 6 seconds ago      224.3 MB
```
by default it uses project name.

Once your image has been built, start a new container.

- `docker run -itd <image_id> console`

Next you can attach to your container.

- `docker attach <container_id>`

And detach using `Ctrl-p Ctrl-q`.


Check below for configuration options.
